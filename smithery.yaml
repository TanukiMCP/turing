# Smithery.ai Deployment Configuration for TuringMCP
# This file specifies how to build and run the cognitive planner on Smithery's platform.

# Use the "container" runtime for custom Docker deployments.
runtime: "container"

# Define the build process for the container.
build:
  # Path to the Dockerfile in the repository.
  dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
  # The context path for the Docker build.
  dockerBuildPath: "."

# Define the start command and server configuration.
startCommand:
  # The server type is "http" as it's a web server.
  type: "http"
  # Since TuringMCP's tools require no external API keys or configuration
  # to be listed, we provide an empty schema. This aligns with Smithery's
  # "lazy loading" best practice, allowing users to discover the server's
  # capabilities without any initial setup.
  configSchema:
    type: "object"
    properties: {}
  # Example configuration is empty for the same reason.
